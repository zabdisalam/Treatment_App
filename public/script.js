A good foundation in these disciplines won’t just help you write code and de-bug software – they’ll help you in other areas of your life and studies, too. When you major in Computers and Technology, you’ll have the opportunity to be involved in innovation and to do work that has a real impact on society.

Furthermore, in the past couple of years, more and more people are becoming health conscious. They want to remain fit and take care of themselves.
